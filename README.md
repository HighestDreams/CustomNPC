<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

There are many npc/slapper plugin available for pocketmine-mp, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs! so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a npc plugin so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it! isn't it? ðŸ˜œ.

Here's why:
* Don't need to use commands for upgrading npc stuff like size/name/skin and more.
* NPCs are fully customizable and you can do all the steps with UI forms.
* Great features and much more!.

Of course, no one plugin will serve all servers since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or <a href='https://github.com/HighestDreams/CustomNPC/issues/new'>opening an issue</a>. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this plugin!
